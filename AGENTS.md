# Engineering Standards Agent

## Overview

This project provides reusable engineering standards for AI coding agents (OpenCode, Cursor, Copilot, etc.). It enforces coding practices, SOLID principles, TDD micro-commit workflows, and code quality standards across any project.

## Core Principles

You MUST follow these principles for ALL code changes. No exceptions.

### 1. Micro-Commit Workflow
Every logical change = one commit. Never bundle multiple logical changes into one commit.

- One refactoring step per commit
- One feature implementation per commit
- One test update per commit
- One documentation update per commit

### 2. TDD Micro-Commit Cycle
For ALL code changes, follow the STOP -> RED -> GREEN -> COMMIT -> REFACTOR -> COMMIT cycle. See `docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` for the full workflow.

### 3. Production-Ready Commits
Every commit MUST be production-ready:
- All tests pass
- Build succeeds
- No lint errors
- Code is deployable

### 4. Code Quality Rules
- Maximum method length: 15 lines (excluding blank lines and braces)
- Maximum class length: 300 lines (consider refactoring if larger)
- Maximum 0-2 private methods per class (SRP guideline)
- Maximum 5 parameters per method (use parameter objects)
- No duplicated code (DRY principle)

### 5. SOLID Principles
- **SRP**: Each class has ONE reason to change
- **OCP**: Open for extension, closed for modification (use Strategy Pattern)
- **LSP**: Subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **ISP**: Prefer focused interfaces over fat interfaces
- **DIP**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes (use dependency injection)

### 6. Commit Message Format
Use Conventional Commits:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[body explaining WHY, not WHAT]
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, test, docs, perf, chore

### 7. Testing Standards
- Minimum 80% test coverage overall
- 100% coverage for critical paths
- Use Given-When-Then structure
- Descriptive test names (e.g., `shouldSelectLatestVersionWhenAvailable`)
- Never commit failing tests (every commit must be production-ready, no exceptions)

## External File Loading

CRITICAL: When you encounter a file reference below, use your Read tool to load it on a need-to-know basis. They contain detailed instructions relevant to SPECIFIC tasks.

Do NOT preemptively load all references. Use lazy loading based on actual need.

## Before Making ANY Code Changes

1. Read and acknowledge: "I will follow the micro-commit workflow"
2. Create a task list using TodoWrite to break down the work
3. Execute one task at a time, committing after each one
4. Run tests before every commit
5. Follow the pre-commit checklist

## Red Flags (Stop and Ask User)

If you encounter these situations, STOP and ask:

1. **Unclear scope**: Change requires modifying 10+ files
2. **Breaking change**: Change will break a public API
3. **Test failures**: Tests failing after your change
4. **Conflicting patterns**: Existing code doesn't follow SOLID
5. **Missing tests**: Code being changed has < 80% coverage

## Agent Pledge

"I will follow the engineering standards for every code change, no exceptions. Every commit will be production-ready."
