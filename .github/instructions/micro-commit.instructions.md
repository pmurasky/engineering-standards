# Micro-Commit Workflow

When making code changes, follow the TDD micro-commit workflow strictly.

## Every Logical Change = One Commit

Never bundle multiple logical changes into one commit:
- One refactoring step per commit
- One feature implementation per commit
- One test update per commit
- One documentation update per commit

## TDD Cycle
For ALL code changes, follow the STOP -> RED -> GREEN -> COMMIT -> REFACTOR -> COMMIT cycle. See `docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` for the full workflow.

## Commit Message Format

Use Conventional Commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` — see `docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md` for format, types, and examples.

## Production-Ready Commits

Every commit MUST be production-ready:
- All tests pass
- Build succeeds
- No lint errors
- Code is deployable

## Red Flags - STOP and Ask

- Change requires modifying 10+ files
- Change will break a public API
- Tests failing after your change
- Code being changed has < 80% test coverage

For the full workflow, see `docs/AI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`.
