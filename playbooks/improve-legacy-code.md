# Playbook: Improve Legacy Code

1. Confirm active thresholds from `../references/quality/team-tunables.md`.
2. Map risk zones and missing tests.
3. Add characterization tests around current behavior.
4. Refactor in small, isolated moves.
5. Prefer extraction and dependency inversion before deeper redesign.
6. Re-run tests after each move.
7. Commit in small slices with explicit intent.
