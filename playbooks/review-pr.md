# Playbook: Review PR

1. Validate behavior against stated requirements and active thresholds from `../references/quality/team-tunables.md`.
2. Check test evidence quality, not just test count.
3. Identify SOLID regressions and architecture drift.
4. Flag maintainability risks: complexity, coupling, duplication.
5. Confirm pre-commit quality gates are satisfied.
6. Return findings ordered by severity with concrete fixes.
