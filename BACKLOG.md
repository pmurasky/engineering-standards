# Engineering Standards - Enhancement Backlog

Tracking document for improvements to the engineering standards project.

## P1 - Should Fix (Significant improvement)

- [ ] **Bring Cline rules to parity with other tools** -- `.clinerules/` has `engineering-standards.md`, `nextjs.md`, and `typescript.md` but is still missing parity content (for example `code-review.md`, `java.md`, `kotlin.md`) available in other tool configs.

## P2 - Nice to Have (Valuable additions)

### Additional Standards Topics

- [ ] **Add API design standards** -- REST, GraphQL, gRPC conventions. Endpoint naming, versioning, pagination, error response formats.

- [ ] **Add error handling patterns doc** -- Cross-language strategies: Result types, error codes vs exceptions, error boundaries, retry patterns.

- [ ] **Add database/SQL standards** -- Query optimization, migrations, ORM patterns, connection pooling, transaction management.

- [ ] **Add observability standards** -- Metrics, distributed tracing, health checks, alerting, SLOs/SLIs.

- [ ] **Add Docker/containerization standards** -- Dockerfile best practices, multi-stage builds, security scanning, image sizing.

- [ ] **Add CI/CD pipeline standards** -- Pipeline-as-code, deployment strategies (blue/green, canary), environment promotion, rollback.

- [ ] **Add git branching strategy** -- Trunk-based development vs GitFlow guidance, branch naming, PR conventions.

- [ ] **Add accessibility standards** -- WCAG compliance, semantic HTML, ARIA, CLI accessibility beyond current 6 lines.

### Additional Language Standards

- [ ] **Add C#/.NET standards** -- Globs cover `*.cs` but no doc exists.
- [ ] **Add Rust standards** -- Globs cover `*.rs` but no doc exists.
- [ ] **Add Swift standards** -- Globs cover `*.swift` but no doc exists.
- [ ] **Add Ruby standards** -- Globs cover `*.rb` but no doc exists.
- [ ] **Add C/C++ standards** -- Globs cover `*.c, *.cpp` but no doc exists.

### Inconsistencies to Fix

- [ ] **Verify Copilot reads CLAUDE.md** -- README compatibility matrix claims Copilot reads CLAUDE.md. May not be accurate.
