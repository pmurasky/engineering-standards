# Next.js Standards

When working with Next.js framework files, follow the conventions in `docs/NEXTJS_STANDARDS.md`.

Read that file for guidance on Server/Client component boundaries, data fetching
and cache revalidation, route handlers, security, performance, and testing.
For TypeScript language standards, also reference `docs/TYPESCRIPT_STANDARDS.md`.
