# Kotlin Standards

When working with Kotlin files, follow the conventions in `docs/KOTLIN_STANDARDS.md`.
Read that file for Kotlin-specific guidance on naming, null safety, coroutines, and testing.
For design patterns, also reference `docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`.
For SOLID principles with Kotlin-specific examples, see `docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md`.
