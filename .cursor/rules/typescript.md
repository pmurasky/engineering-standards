# TypeScript Standards

When working with TypeScript files, follow the conventions in `docs/TYPESCRIPT_STANDARDS.md`.

Read that file for guidance on strict compiler settings, type-system rules,
runtime validation, async safety, linting, and testing practices.
For design patterns, also reference `docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`.
For SOLID principles with multi-language examples, see `docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md`.
