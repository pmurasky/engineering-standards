# Code Review Standards

Use this rule as a compact checklist and defer details to canonical docs.

## Quick Checks
- SOLID principles enforced
- Code quality gates respected (method/class size, parameter limits, DRY)
- Test expectations met (coverage intent, naming clarity, behavior-focused tests)
- Security and maintainability risks called out clearly

Canonical references:
- `docs/CODING_PRACTICES.md`
- `docs/PRE_COMMIT_CHECKLIST.md`
- `docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md`
