# TypeScript Standards

When working with TypeScript files, follow the conventions in `docs/TYPESCRIPT_STANDARDS.md`.

Focus on:
- Strict typing and runtime boundary validation
- Avoiding `any` and floating promises
- Discriminated unions and exhaustive handling
- Domain-driven module boundaries and dependency direction
- Deterministic tests and clear error handling

For design patterns, also reference `docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`.
For SOLID principles with multi-language examples, see `docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md`.
