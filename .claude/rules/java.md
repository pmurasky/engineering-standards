# Java Standards

When working with Java code, follow the conventions defined in `docs/JAVA_STANDARDS.md`.

Read that file for detailed Java-specific guidance on:
- Modern Java 21 features (records, sealed classes, pattern matching)
- Null safety with Optional
- Immutability patterns
- Constructor-based dependency injection
- Stream and collection idioms
- Exception handling
- Testing with JUnit 5 and AssertJ
For design patterns, also reference `docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`.
For SOLID principles with Java-specific examples, see `docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md`.
