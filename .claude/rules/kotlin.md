# Kotlin Standards

When working with Kotlin code, follow the conventions defined in `docs/KOTLIN_STANDARDS.md`.

Read that file for detailed Kotlin-specific guidance on:
- Naming conventions
- Null safety patterns
- Coroutine usage
- Extension functions
- Data classes and sealed classes
- Testing with Kotlin
For design patterns, also reference `docs/DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`.
For SOLID principles with Kotlin-specific examples, see `docs/SOLID_PRINCIPLES.md`.
